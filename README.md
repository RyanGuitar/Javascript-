# Javascript

## From The Ground Up

A beginner guide to JavaScript - starting on a solid foundation. 

This tutorial will cover the basics of JavaScript, basics not meaning easy or diluted, but instead a complete coverage of all the aspects of the language explained in simple terms with short useable code snippets exploring each concept in turn. 

The goal is to give the student a solid foundation so she can explore more advanced sources with confidence. It is more difficult to learn a new topic when you have already learned bad habits. Trying to unlearn faulty concepts is difficult and time consuming. 

A better approach is to give the student a clear view of the matter to master in simple digestable chuncks so that the information can be quickly absorbed. 

Armed with this bird's-eye view the student would have grasped the big picture and will understand how all the pieces fit together. 

The guide must not shy away or gloss over the "difficult" parts as this leads to anxiety when these issues are suddenly introduced in other sources in overly complex ways.
